# CulturePulse

CulturePulse is a small, static site that highlights Rwandan culture through storytelling, mission-focused programs, and community voices. It includes four HTML pages styled with a single CSS file and shares a common navigation layout.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Landing page with hero, about, featured projects, and skills sections.
- `mission.html` – Mission statement and focus areas of CulturePulse.
- `voice.html` – Curated stories, poetry, dance, and music highlights.
- `contact.html` – Contact form for inquiries and collaboration.
- `style.css` – Global styling, responsive layout rules, and component styles.
- `assets/` – Images used throughout the site.
- `demo.mp4` – Optional promotional or preview media.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or copy the repository to your machine.
2. Open any of the HTML files directly in a web browser to preview the site.
3. If you run a local server (recommended), use something simple like:

   ```sh
   # Use Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

## Customization

- Update text content within the respective HTML pages to reflect new programs or stories.
- Replace images inside the `assets/` directory while keeping filenames the same to avoid breaking references.
- Adjust styles or color themes in `style.css` (look for the CSS variables defined at the top).
- Modify the footer newsletter form action handler to point to your email marketing or backend service.

## Browser Compatibility

The site uses modern CSS features (flex, grid, custom properties) and works best in current versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.

This project is shared for portfolio and personal use. Adapt it as needed for your cultural storytelling initiatives.
